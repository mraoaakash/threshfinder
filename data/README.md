## Instructions
### 1. Download the Data
You can find the NuCLS dataset at this link: [nucls](https://sites.google.com/view/nucls/home?pli=1) and we require specifically the NuCLS EvaluationSet which can be found here: [NuclsEvalSet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U8SrL8ChE7ByXa6cgN2Tm5jYjb565zV8?usp=sharing) or [https://sites.google.com/view/nucls/multi-rater](https://sites.google.com/view/nucls/multi-rater).

Download this data and kindly place it in this folder (the data folder) of this repository. Name the parent folder as `NuclsEvalSet` and the subfolder as `data`. The folder structure should look like this:
```
threshfinder
├─ data
    ├─ NuclsEvalSet
```
